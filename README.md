# AWCoordinatesRegex

A simple regular expression for parsing an Active Worlds coordinate string. The regex can be found in the `coordinateRegex` variable in [test.js](/test.js), which uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a vessel with which unit tests are run to ensure that the regex runs as expected. Please be advised that although the test framework used in this repository is JavaScript-driven, you can take this regular expression and use it in whichever language you would like (with potential minor adjustments, of course).
